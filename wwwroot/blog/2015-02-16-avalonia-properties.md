In this post I'm going to explore [Avalonia](https://github.com/grokys/Avalonia/)'s version of the
XAML frameworks' `DependencyProperty` - `AvaloniaProperty`.

# Avalonia Properties #

AvaloniaProperty is the equivalent of WPF's DependencyProperty. Dependency/Avalonia properties give
you a number of important features over simple .NET properties with `INotifyPropertyChanged`:

* **Property value inheritance**. If the `FontFamily` property is not set on a control it will use the
`FontFamily` of its parent, which if it's not set will use the value of *it's* parent and so on. In
this way, setting `FontFamily` on the top-level `Window` can affect all of the controls contained
in that window.
* **Attached Properties**. Attached properties can be defined which can add arbitrary properties to
controls. The control itself doesn't need to know what to do with an attached property - the
behaviour can be handled elsewhere. An example of an attached property is `Grid.Column`.
* **Default values**. The value for each property applicable to a control doesn't need to be stored
unless it differs from the default value.
* **Coercion**. Avalonia properties can also register a callback to handle coercion.
* **Binding**. The value of a `AvaloniaProperty` can be bound to the result of an `IObservable`.
* **Binding Priorities**. Bindings may have a priority, so that values that come from the styling
system can be overridden by values that are set locally.

# Declaring a Avalonia Property #

Declaring a `DependencyProperty` in WPF looks something like this:

```charp
public static readonly DependencyProperty PropertyDeclaration =
	DependencyProperty.Register(
	    "PropertyName",
	    typeof(PropertyType),
	    typeof(OwnerClass),
	    new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(
	        default(PropertyType),
	        FrameworkPropertyMetadataOptions.Inherits));

public PropertyType PropertyName
{
    get { return (PropertyType)this.GetValue(PropertyDeclaration); }
    set { this.SetValue(PropertyDeclaration, value); }
}
```

A lot of boilerplate there. With  generics and default parameters we can make it look a bit nicer:

```charp
public static readonly AvaloniaProperty<PropertyType> PropertyDeclaration =
    AvaloniaProperty.Register<OwnerClass, PropertyType>("PropertyName", inherits: true);

public PropertyType PropertyName
{
    get { return this.GetValue(PropertyDeclaration); }
    set { this.SetValue(PropertyDeclaration, value); }
}
```

What can we see here?

- AvaloniaProperties are typed, so no more having to cast in the getter.
- We pass the property type and owner class as a generic type to `Register()` so we don't have to
write `typeof()` twice.
- We used default parameter values in `Register()` so that defaults don't have to be restated.

Like `DependencyProperty`s in XAML, avalonia properties need to be defined on a class that inherits
from the `AvaloniaObject` class.

# Adding a Avalonia Property to Another Type #

Just like in WPF, you can share avalonia properties between unrelated controls by calling
`AvaloniaProperty.AddOwner':

```charp
public static readonly AvaloniaProperty<int> FooProperty =
    RegisteringControl.FooProperty.AddOwner<AnotherControl>();
```

# Property Value Inheritance #

Here we declare an inherited integer property called "Foo":

```charp
public static readonly AvaloniaProperty<int> FooProperty =
    AvaloniaProperty.Register<OwnerClass, int>("Foo", inherits: true);
```

By specifying the `inherits: true` parameter in the call to `AvaloniaProperty.Register`, we are
saying that in the absence of an explicitly set value for "Foo" on a control, the value from the
parent control should be used.

Note, `AvaloniaObject` is defined at a lower level than the concept of "parent controls" so
`AvaloniaObject` uses the protected `InheritanceParent` property to determine the parent control.
This is automatically set by `Visual` (which inherits from `AvaloniaObject`) so you shouldn't usually
have to worry about it.

## Attached Properties

Attached properties are essentially the same as attached dependency properties in WPF. They are
defined by calling `AvaloniaProperty.RegisterAttached`:

```charp
public static readonly AvaloniaProperty<int> ColumnProperty =
    AvaloniaProperty.RegisterAttached<Grid, Control, int>("Column");
```

## Default Values

Default values are provided in the call to `AvaloniaProperty.Register` or `RegisterAttached`. If no
default value is provided the default is taken to be `default(TValue)`.

```charp
public static readonly AvaloniaProperty<int> FooProperty =
    AvaloniaProperty.Register<OwnerClass, int>("Foo", defaultValue: 42);
```

Just like in WPF, you can override the default value for a specific type:

```charp
FooProperty.OverrideDefaultValue(typeof(AnotherControl), 64);
```


## Coercion

Coercion allows a control to react to changes in a property's value and make sure that the value is
within a valid range. For example a "Percentage" property may only allow values between 0 and 100:

```charp
public static readonly AvaloniaProperty<double> PercentageProperty =
    AvaloniaProperty.Register<OwnerClass, double>("Percentage", coerce: CoercePercentage);

private static double CoercePercentage(AvaloniaObject o, double value)
{
	return Math.Min(100, Math.Max(0, value));
}
```

The coercion method must be static, so the object on which the property change has taken place is
passed as a parameter. It's important to note that you should not assume that the type of the object
is the same as the type that registered the property as properties can be added to other classes  
using `AvaloniaProperty.AddOwner`. If you need to access the object on which the property change has
taken place you should check the type first.

Currently coercion cannot be overridden for other classes, this is a limitation that may need to be
lifted in future.

# Binding #

Binding in Avalonia uses Reactive Extensions' [IObservable](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd990377.aspx). To bind an IObservable to a property, use the `Bind()` method:

```charp
control.Bind(BorderProperty, someObject.SomeObservable());
```

Note that because AvaloniaProperty is typed, we can check that the observable is of the correct type.

To get the value of a property as an observable, call `GetObservable()`:

```charp
var observable = control.GetObservable(Control.FooProperty);
```

# Binding Priorities #

A binding may also have a priority. The `BindingPriority` enumeration gives a set of common
priorities:

```charp
public enum BindingPriority
{
    Animation = -1,
    LocalValue,
    StyleTrigger,
    TemplatedParent,
    Style,
    Unset = int.MaxValue,
}
```

As you can see, lower integral values are considered to be of a higher priority. We'll explore how priorites work in [another post][d677c3e6].

# Binding in Initialization Lists #

One of the goals of avalonia was to make defining a UI in code almost as painless as using markup.
To these ends, you can use initalization lists everywhere to give a XAML-like feel to your control
declarations in C#:

```charp
return new Panel
{
	Children = new Controls
	{
		new TextBlock
		{
			Text = "Hello World!"
		}
	}
};
```

This works fine for avalonia properties that are exposed as standard .NET properties, but how can we
make this work for attached properties and bindings? Well, C# 6 introduces a new feature called
[index initializers](https://roslyn.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Language%20Feature%20Status&referringTitle=Home)
which can allow us to do this:

```charp
var control = new Control
{
	Property1 = "Foo",
    [Attached.Property] = "Bar",
}
```

Nice... Now lets suppose we want to bind a property:

```charp
var control = new Control
{
    Property1 = "Foo",
    [Attached.Property] = "Bar",
    [!Property2] = something.SomeObservable,
}
```

Yep, by putting a bang in front of the property name you can **bind** to a property (attached or
otherwise) from the object initializer.

Binding to a property on another control? Easy:

```charp
var control = new Control
{
    Property1 = "Foo",
    [Attached.Property] = "Bar",
    [!Property2] = anotherControl[!Property1],
}
```

Two way binding? Just add two bangs:

```charp
var control = new Control
{
    Property1 = "Foo",
    [Attached.Property] = "Bar",
    [!!Property2] = anotherControl[!!Property1],
}
```

If you're writing a control template however, you don't want to bind at the LocalValue binding
priority, you want to bind using the `TemplatedParent` binding priority. To do this use the tilde
operator instead. Here's an example from `ScrollViewer`'s control template:

```charp
new ScrollContentPresenter
{
    Id = "contentPresenter",
    [~ScrollContentPresenter.ContentProperty] = control[~ScrollViewer.ContentProperty],
    [~~ScrollContentPresenter.ExtentProperty] = control[~~ScrollViewer.ExtentProperty],
    [~~ScrollContentPresenter.OffsetProperty] = control[~~ScrollViewer.OffsetProperty],
    [~~ScrollContentPresenter.ViewportProperty] = control[~~ScrollViewer.ViewportProperty],
    [~ScrollContentPresenter.CanScrollHorizontallyProperty] = control[~ScrollViewer.CanScrollHorizontallyProperty],
},
```

As before, doubling up the tilde operator creates a two-way binding.
