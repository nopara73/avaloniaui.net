We’re pleased to announce that Beta 1 of [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) is now available.

Avalonia is a cross platform .NET UI framework inspired by WPF, with XAML, data binding, lookless controls and much more. Avalonia is the only way to bring XAML-based applications to Windows, Mac and Linux.

We've decided that we're now at a stage where we're happy to come out of Alpha and call our current state Beta! People are already creating awesome applications with Avalonia, such as [Avalon Studio](https://github.com/VitalElement/AvalonStudio) - an IDE Avalonia and [Core2D](https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/Core2D) - a data-driven 2D diagram editor, and this represents the first step towards getting the framework production-ready.

That's not to say there's not a lot still left to do - there is, most notably our documentation! Getting started with Avalonia is still difficult due to our lack of documentation and we hope to start putting some more time into documentation moving forward. Anticipating this, we've now got a site up at http://avaloniaui.net/  with s

The easiest way to get started with Avalonia is to install our [Visual Studio plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AvaloniaTeam.AvaloniaforVisualStudio) and use the templates we provide there or use our [.NET core templates](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/avalonia-dotnet-templates). Check out our [samples](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/tree/master/samples) for some examples of how to get started writing an application.

There have been a few architectural changes in this release that we hope will aid us moving forward:

- We are now on the .NET Standard 2.0 platform
- We're now using [Portable.Xaml](https://github.com/cwensley/Portable.Xaml) as our XAML parser
- We've removed support for Cairo and GTK2 - you should now use the Skia and GTK3 or MonoMac backends for non-windows platforms
- We're now using ReactiveUI 8 rather than shipping our own fork
- We've created the [avaloniaui.net](http://avaloniaui.net/) site which, although very bare-bones at the moment, we hope to grow into a decent source of documentation

So here's some of the major features in this release:

## Deferred Rendering

We were previously rendering the entire window each time something changed, which was obviously rather inefficient. [#827](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/827) added a `DeferredRenderer`  which renders to a low-level scenegraph on the UI thread which is then rendered to the window on a separate render thread.

This greatly improves our rendering performance - particularly when animations are involved - and also gives us proper hit-testing of controls.

The old renderer is still available as the `ImmediateRenderer` class for those folks who want to render everything every frame.

## Monomac-based Backend

[#1005](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/1005) introduced a new Monomac-based backend for Mac OSX platforms. Previously one would use the GTK2 or GTK3 backends on OSX, but now the default is closed to the metal!

## Relative Source Syntax Sugar

[#1209](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/1209) introduced shorthand for binding to other controls relative to the control being bound. In WPF, this is achieved by using the `RelativeSource` syntax on a `{Binding}`, as a (slightly contrived example) this is how you would bind a `TextBlock`'s text to the `Tag` property on a parent control:

```xml
<Border Tag="Hello World">
  <TextBlock Text="{Binding Text, RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type Border} AncestorLevel=1}}"/>
</Border>
```

Now Avalonia has new syntax to achieve this without the verbosity:

```xml
<Border Tag="Hello World">
  <TextBlock Text="{Binding $parent.Text}"/>
</Border>
```

`$parent` isn't the only syntax this feature adds, here are some more things you can do:


| Shorthand                 | Implementation                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `$self`                   | `Mode = Self`                            |
| `$parent`                 | `Mode = FindAncestor; AncestorLevel = 1` |
| `$parent[Level]`          | `Mode = FindAncestor; AncestorLevel = Level +1` |
| `$parent[ns:Type]`        | `Mode = FindAncestor; AncestorType = ns:Type` |
| `$parent[ns:Type; Level]` | `Mode = FindAncestor; AncestorType = ns:Type; AncestorLevel = Level + 1` |

## Drawings

`Drawing` is a convenient way to create vector icons, used by WPF. The [Visual Studio Image Library](http://vsicons-msdn.azurewebsites.net/) provides many icons as Drawings, and there are other tools that can produce them. They are much more lightweight compared to `Shape` controls since they are not part of the visual tree. 

[1117](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/1117) added support for Drawings to Avalonia, though our standard image control still can't display them - in the meantime while we add support for that, drawings can be displayed in a `DrawingPresenter` control.

## Remoting and New Previewer

[#1105](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/1105) introduced a new previewer architecture which should allow us to make designers for non-windows platforms. The previous previewer used win32 API voodoo to reparent the window of the application into the designer. The new previewer architecture instead uses a TCP transport protocol which communicates between the application and the designer in a platform-independent manner.

The [AvaloniaVS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AvaloniaTeam.AvaloniaforVisualStudio) extension has already been updated to use this new protocol, and hopefully now designers for other IDEs will be coming soon!

## StaticResource and DynamicResource

[#1130](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/1130) added `Control.Resources`, `StaticResource` and `DynamicResource`.

The new features are designed to follow WPF/UWP as closely as possible - previously, resources could only be contained in `<Style>`s and we used `{StyleResource}` to access these resources. Now each control has its own `Resources` dictionary and `{StaticResource}` and `{DynamicResource}` are used to access them. `{StyleResource}` has now be removed, so you will need to update all uses of that markup extension to `{DynamicResource}`.

## Bind Commands to Methods

Ever get annoyed that you have to create an `ICommand` to bind a button command, and wish you could just point your binding to a method? Since [`#1179`](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/1179) you can! 

```csharp
public class ViewModel
{
    public void ButtonClicked()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hooray!");
    }
}
```

```xml
<Button Command="{Binding ButtonClicked}"/>
```

## Calendar Control

[#1244](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/pull/1244) ported the [Silverlight Calendar](https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/SilverlightToolkit) control to Avalonia, for all your calendaring needs.
