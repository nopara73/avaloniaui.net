Title: Button
---
The [`Button`](/api/Avalonia.Controls/Border/) control is a [`ContentControl`](contentcontrol)
which reacts to pointer presses.

A button notifies clicks by raising the [`Click`](/api/Avalonia.Controls/Button/61B1E7A8) event.
A click is distinct from a `PointerDown` event in that it is raised by default when the button is
pressed and then released (although this behavior can be changed by setting the 
[`ClickMode`](/api/Avalonia.Controls/Button/7B4CADF5) property).

Alternatively an instance of [`ICommand`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/api/system.windows.input.icommand?view=netstandard-2.0)
can be assigned or bound to the button's [`Command`](/api/Avalonia.Controls/Button/4AAA993D)
property. This command will be executed when the button is clicked. For more information see
[binding to commands](/docs/binding/binding-to-commands.md).
